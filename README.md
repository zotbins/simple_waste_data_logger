# Introduction
I wanted a way to keep track of how much waste I was generating just to be more environmentally conscious. So I created this project as an automated way to help keep track of waste accumulation through fullness measurements while also taking pictures of the objects thrown away.

To achieve this, I use the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor along with the ESP32-CAM and save the measurements to a micro SD card. Doing this type of waste tracking is called a waste audit, which is a common practice used by universities to keep track of waste goals while also looking for opportunities increasing waste diversion rates.

# ZotBins Community Edition

This is the first step of a multi-part project of creating a smart waste ecosystem called [ZotBins](https://zotbins.github.io), which is already deployed at UCI. Currently, I am helping to further expand the concept of ZotBins where any city, business, university, classroom, or home could implement a smart waste system. This open-source version ZotBins is called  ZotBins Community Edition (ZBCE). To learn more about this initiative please visit the [ZotBins Community Edition Blog](https://zotbins.github.io/zbceblog/about/)
